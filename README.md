# GOALS

Knowledge bases like the TAC KBP graph are noisy.
We want to know which algorithm is most suitable
for label acquisition?

There are existing algorithms for KBC, but they can
only be applied to attribute propagation through a
convoluted step of reducing the Vertex Labeling
problem to Knowledge Base Completion.

However, what we want to know is that what are the
existing frameworks for Knowledge Base Completion
and Vertex Labeling? And which of these are going
to be reasonable baselines?
